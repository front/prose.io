gem "rake"                # actually not need for heroku but for the provided Rakefile
gem "RedCloth"            # if you want to use the Textile Markup Language
gem "jekyll", "~> 0.11.2" # we need at least this version so jekyll will use Ruby 1.9.2
gem "foreman"             # this is a tool to test and use the Procfile locally
gem "heroku"              # if you install the Heroku Toolbelt you won't need this but it's good practice
